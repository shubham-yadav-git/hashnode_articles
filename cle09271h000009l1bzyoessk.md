# Docker Swarm

## **What is a docker swarm?**

Docker Swarm is a tool that makes it easier to manage multiple Docker containers. With Docker Swarm, you can group containers and treat them as a single unit. This makes it easier to deploy, manage, and scale applications.

Think of Docker Swarm as a manager for your Docker containers. It helps you keep everything organized and running smoothly, so you don't have to worry about individual containers. Instead, you can focus on your applications as a whole.

Using Docker Swarm is straightforward. You set up a swarm, add your containers to it, and then use commands to manage the swarm as a whole. This makes it easy to deploy and manage applications, no matter how many containers you have.

In short, Docker Swarm is a helpful tool that makes managing Docker containers simple and efficient. Try it out and see the difference it can make!

## **How to create a docker swarm?**

Creating a Docker Swarm is a straightforward process that involves a few simple steps. Here's how to do it:

1. Install Docker on your host machine(s). Make sure you have the latest version of Docker installed.
    
2. Initialize the swarm on one of the host machines. This machine will be the manager node in the swarm. To initialize the swarm, run the following command in a terminal window:
    

```bash
docker swarm init
```

To initialize the swarm with an advertised address, use the following command instead:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <advertised-address>
```

Replace &lt;advertised-address&gt; with the IP address or hostname that you want to use for the manager node. This IP address or hostname will be used by worker nodes to join the swarm.

Keep in mind that the advertised address should be reachable by all worker nodes that you want to join the swarm. If the manager node is behind a firewall, make sure the necessary ports are open.

## How to add a worker/Manager node to a swarm?

1. Add worker nodes to the swarm. If you have other host machines that you want to join the swarm, run the following command on each of those machines:
    

```bash
docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>:<port>
```

Replace &lt;token&gt; with the join token displayed when you initialized the swarm, and &lt;manager-ip&gt; with the IP address of the manager node. The &lt;port&gt; is usually 2377.

2\. Verify the nodes in the swarm. On the manager node, you can use the following command to check the nodes in the swarm:

```bash
docker node ls
```

3\. Deploy services in the swarm. Once your swarm is set up, you can deploy services to it using the docker service create command. For example:

```bash
docker service create --replicas 3 --name my-web-service my-web-image
```

This creates a service named "my-web-service" using the image "my-web-image" and ensures that three replicas of the service are running in the swarm.

And that's it! With these steps, you can create a Docker Swarm and start deploying and managing your containers.

## How to generate the join token?

To generate a join token for a manager node or a worker node in a Docker Swarm, you first need to initialize the swarm as a manager node. Once the swarm is initialized, you can use the following commands to generate the join tokens:

1. Manager join token:
    

```bash
docker swarm join-token manager 
```

This will output the command that can be used to join the swarm as a manager node. You can copy the command and run it on another host to join the swarm as a manager node.

1. Worker join token:
    

```bash
docker swarm join-token worker 
```

This will output the command that can be used to join the swarm as a worker node. You can copy the command and run it on another host to join the swarm as a worker node.

It's important to note that join tokens are used for security purposes and are only valid for a short period of time. Make sure to generate a new join token each time you need to add a new node to the swarm.

## **How to scale up and scale down a service?**

To scale up or down service in a Docker Swarm, you can use the following commands:

1. Scale up a service:
    

```bash
docker service scale <service-name>=<number-of-replicas>
```

Replace &lt;service-name&gt; with the name of the service that you want to scale, and &lt;number-of-replicas&gt; with the desired number of replicas of the service.

For example, if you want to scale up the service "my-web-service" to 5 replicas, you would run :

```bash
docker service scale my-web-service=5
```

1. Scale down a service:
    

```bash
docker service scale <service-name>=<number-of-replicas>
```

Replace &lt;service-name&gt; with the name of the service that you want to scale, and &lt;number-of-replicas&gt; with the desired number of replicas of the service.

For example, if you want to scale down the service "my-web-service" to 3 replicas, you would run:

```bash
docker service scale my-web-service=3
```

With these commands, you can easily scale up or down your services in a Docker Swarm, ensuring that your applications have the resources they need to run smoothly.

## **Remove a service**

```bash
docker service rm <service-name>
```

Replace &lt;service-name&gt; with the name of the service that you want to remove.

For example, if you want to remove the service "my-web-service", you would run:

```bash
docker service rm my-web-service
```

This will remove the service and all of its replicas from the swarm. Keep in mind that removing a service will also remove any resources associated with it, including containers, networks, and volumes. Make sure you understand the impact of removing a service before doing so.
